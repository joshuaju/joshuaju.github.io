# Is this you?

- You don’t stop at syntactical correctness. Code is not just meant for the compiler, so you write code anyone can reason about.
- You try to stay on top of the complexity of your software. Over time, complexity will outgrow your mental capacities, so you actively work against it.
- You want to understand what the customer really wants. Vaguely formulated requirements are a nightmare, so you won’t stop questioning them.

# Who am I?

Software engineering is on my mind night and day; drawing me in. It’s not just all code and requires more than hacking away at your keyboard.

Since 2013 I am continuously learning what it means to be a software engineer. During my bachelor studies I gathered practical experience in a trainee program; algorithms, programming languages and ADTs are all fine, but what about the bigger picture? I wanted to dive deeper. My master studies in software engineering were focussed on the things beyond coding.

Now, as of 2022, I am looking back on more than four years of industry experience as a software developer. At the core I am a backend developer, predominantly working with Java and Spring Boot. My focus is software architecture and quality, which I strive to improve every day.
